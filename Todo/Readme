    #Project Title: To-Do List Application

##Project Description: Create a simple command-line to-do list application in Python that allows users to manage their tasks. This project will help you practice working with data structures, user input, and basic file handling.

###Key Features you can include:

* **Add tasks**: Users should be able to add tasks to their to-do list with a title and a description.

* **List tasks**: Users can view their existing tasks with details like title, description, and a unique task ID.

* **Mark tasks as complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete or uncompleted.

* **Delete tasks:** Users can remove tasks from their to-do list.

* **Save tasks**: Implement file handling to save tasks to a text file, so users can retrieve them even after closing the program.

* **Load tasks**: Allow users to load their saved tasks from the text file when they start the program.

* **User-friendly interface**: Create a simple and intuitive command-line interface that guides users through the available actions.
